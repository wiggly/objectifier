# TODO

## Add nillable items

We should allow some things to be nil. The key is present but the value may be nil instead of either fully required or not required.

## Add transformers for boolean values

## Decide whether or not using class names for the transformer types is a good idea (probably not)

## Add Struct in addition to Map types

## Make transformer factory configurable on a per-objectifier basis

## Re-factor so that scalar/array/map also come from transformer factory?

## Add default values for optional items?

## Pass transformer factory through transformers so they can access transformers that exist when de-serializing objects
